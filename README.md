# NetworkProgramming

INSA project - with collaborator nyandog26

UDP-based data transfer emulation in C via the socket.io lib with a main objective of efficiency. In this school project, each server is adapted to a different kind of client. Clients' source code was not available, so we had to understand how to adapt to their packet dropping habits and build protocols to optimize the data transmission rate in each case.

Of around 50 competing groups of students, our rates are in the top 25%.
